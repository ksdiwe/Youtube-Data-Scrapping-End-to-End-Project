<h3> Introduction </h3>

[Web App](https://ksdiwe-youtube-data-scrapping-end-to-end-pr-yt-dashboard-k671f8.streamlit.app/ )

This is a simple streamlit dashboard, which analyses each video.

I have scrapped the YouTube data using YouTube API.

Data Scrapped:

Five YouTubers ( Krish Naik, Hitesh Choudhary, Telusko, MysirG.com) recent 50 videos from each channel with their subscribers, channel ID, channel published date, views, thumbnail, playlist ID, are extracted.

From each video, viewCount, likeCount, video ID, description, comments with commentators name, no of comments, video title, and thumbnails are extracted.

On the streamlit dashboard, a bar chart is plotted to see who’s subscribers are more and who has more views.

The line chart is to show a video popular in terms of views in the first 30 days of publication.
